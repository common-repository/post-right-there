*   **WP Statistics** to let you view visits count of your posts
*   **Photo Gallery** to let you add photo galleries from the front
*   **Tribe Events Calendar** (partially) to let you edit the basic info of your events





### Custom Meta Fields

Apart from the built in fields mentioned above, it is easy to add support for any custom meta field using the custom filters:<span class="filterWrap">`prth_edit_boxes``prth_add_boxes``prth_edit_post``prth_add_post_before_create`</span> to specify extra fields that can be edited from the front, and to specify fields that are present during the creation of a new post from the front.
For examples see file`built-in-edit-boxes.php`





### Restriction System

The plugins also features a flexible restrictions system that allows to grant user rights to edit or create posts of specific types according to custom criteria. The restrictions system also provides the ability to disallow editing of individual fields or allow these fields to take specific values. For example you may want to allow authors to only publish (custom) posts of specific categories according to their roles.
